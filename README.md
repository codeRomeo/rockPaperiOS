# Rock Paper Scissors iOS app


This game is ported from my [macOS (OSX)](https://github.com/codeRomeo/RockPaperScissorsOSX) project also in Swift language. 
**The main goal of the project is to see if the "model" source code from the OSX project can be ported without any change 
into iOS.** Also, learn about auto layout and  version control. 
 
**This is the primary interface. Its a single view, single screen application.**

Update 8/21: The Model source code was copied as is from the OSX project and compiled with no errors on first go. Theory works!
Update 2018: Updated to swift 4 & Xcode 9 ;  everything still works :-) ;
